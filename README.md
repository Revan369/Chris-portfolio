# Chris-portfolio
in this repo you will find my first portfolio as a web dev in training. it is also the solution to an assignment given by the edx bootcamp course.

first of all created this repo on github, primarily to allow ease of access to my workflow and resulting webpage/portfolio, for my tutors and peers to review, but also to put into practice the lessons i have learned so far on the front end web dev edx bootcamp course. The final webpage/portfolio will be a functioning demonstration of everything i have learned, and a functioning portfolio for myself as a begginer front end web dev.


I added the unfinished css and html for the site. 

i have added placeholder images for now as i do not have any projects to showcase except this portfolio itself, so the links to each project page by clicking the images will return you to the portfolio.

here is a link to the deployed app..
